## Project summary
We employed the long-read sequencing technology, Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT), to annotate the pig transcriptome across 17 tissues from two Yorkshire littermate pigs. More than 9.8 million reads were obtained from a single ONT flow cell, and 69,781 unique transcripts at 50,108 loci were identified. Our study is published on Animal Genetics: https://doi.org/10.1111/age.13274.
## Public data
The Nanopore sequencing data generated in this study can be found in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information with the identifier PRJNA671673 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA671673). The code for data analyses is shown in scripts/nanopore_ann.smk, and the transcriptom annotation can be obtained from https://github.com/liangend/Porcine_Nanopore/releases/download/GTF/filterSamples.gtf
